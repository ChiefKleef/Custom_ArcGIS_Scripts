# Custom_ArcGIS_Scripts
Custom scripts for ArcGIS I've made over time working as a GIS Professional over the last few years.

These tools are all built with Python and with a heavy reliance on the [ArcPy](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/arcpy/what-is-arcpy-.htm) library, which is only available with some licensure from [ESRI](http://www.esri.com/).

Some of these scripts date all the way back to when I first wrote 'hello world' and probably need to be refactored to make them more readable and efficient.
